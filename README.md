# Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Localization
This repo is the official code of ["Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Localization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03179.pdf).

## Introduction
This paper introduces the first unified framework to localize all three kinds of instances in untrimmed videos, including visual actions, sound events and audio-visual events. All these instances contribute equally to a comprehensive understanding of video content.
